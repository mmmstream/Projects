Project files from the stream. Check README for compatibility.

VCV Rack:
I have almost all of the free modules from the VCV Library installed.

REAPER:
Typically i use Surge and Vital. When mixing down, I use a fair few obscure Linux plugins that come with Ubuntu Studio, u-he Protoverb, ReaVerb with an IR file.
When mastering, I use the aforementioned obscure Linux plugins and/or JS Master Limiter. Sorry but you might have to hunt suitable plug-ins and IR files yourself.
